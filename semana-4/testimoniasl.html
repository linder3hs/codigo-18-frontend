        was an EMI for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
        looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
        amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found
        it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was
        the best- and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
        course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software
        Engineer at a VR startup."
